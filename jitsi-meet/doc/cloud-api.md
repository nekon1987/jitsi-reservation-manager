# Jitsi Meet Cloud API

The Jitsi Meet Cloud API is a specification for services which can support the integration of Jitsi Meet into other applications, for mapping conferences for dial-in support, and for supporting directory search and user invitations to conferences.

The swagger for these services is provided in [cloud-api.swagger](cloud-api.swagger) in this same repository and directory.
